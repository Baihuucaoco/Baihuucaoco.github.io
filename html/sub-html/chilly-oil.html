        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
          1½-3 cups neutral oil (350-700 ml) <br />
          5 star anise <br />
          1 cinnamon stick (preferably cassia cinnamon) <br />
          2 bay leaves <br />
          3 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns <br />
          2 black cardamom pods (optional) <br />
          4 nuggets dried sand ginger (optional - about 1 tablespoon) <br />
          2 teaspoons cloves (optional) <br />
          3 cloves garlic (optional - crushed) <br />
          1-2 shallots (optional - halved) <br />
          ¾-1 1/4 cup Sichuan chili flakes (65-110g) <br />
          1 - 2 teaspoons salt (to taste)
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gather all the aromatics you plan to use. Place oil and selected
            aromatics into a pot with at least two inches of clearance between
            the oil and the rim of the pot. If using minimum aromatics, 1 ½ cups
            of oil should do it. If using all the aromatics, you can add up to 3
            cups of oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set it over medium heat to start, then progressively lower it to
            medium low or low heat as the oil comes to temperature. The oil
            should be at about 225-250° F / 110-120° C and causing small bubbles
            to slowly rise from the aromatics. If you notice the spices sizzling
            more vigorously than that or turning dark too quickly, reduce the
            heat to cool it down. If you are not achieving small bubbles, slowly
            increase the heat. Hovering around 200-225° F is the safest way to
            prevent burning. Infuse the aromatics this way for a minimum of 30
            minutes, or up to 1 hour for best results.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the oil is infusing, prepare your Sichuan chili flakes by
            placing them in a heatproof bowl. If you used 1½ cups of oil, ¾ cup
            of chili flakes is best. For 3 cups of oil, use 1¼ cups of chili
            flakes. You can experiment within this range (if you like more oil
            and fewer flakes, for instance).
          </li>
          <li>
            You can either heat your oil and pour it through a fine-meshed
            strainer OR remove the spices first with a fine-meshed strainer. If
            your spices are very dark by the time you get to this step, to avoid
            burning, it's safest to remove the spices entirely before pouring
            over the chili flakes. Generally, the oil should be between 225-250°
            F (110-120° C) when pouring over the chili flakes. If you like a
            darker color, opt for 250-275° F/135° C. If your chili flakes are
            already super roasted, you may want to be closer to 225° F/110° C.
            When in doubt, test the oil on a small bowl of chili flakes before
            you do the rest. Carefully pour the hot oil through a strainer onto
            the chili flakes. Stir to evenly distribute the heat of the oil.
            You'll know you've gotten it right when you smell a "popcorn"-like
            smell that is not at all burnt-smelling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in the salt, and allow the chili oil to cool. Store in airtight
            containers in the refrigerator. Always use a clean utensil when
            handling to prevent spoilage. It can last for up to 6 months if
            handled in this way.
